## :// Intro:

User friendly comprehensive Zone Query module
Zoner attempts to re-implement as many features of ZonePlus (and more).

## :// Background:

I started this project in AUGUST OF 2024 after ZonePlus was declared dead by the community. 
This mainly started as a way to make *my FIRST **PUBLIC** resource* making something id use myself and have wanted to remake for a while.

--=====================================================================>

## :// Description:

Stand out feature is the **Parallel Zones implementation**.

In my skewed benchmarking, parallel Zone's doubled the amount of Zones able to be had simultationously (like 10k -> 20k) with no FPS drop (on the simplest detection mode)

--=====================================================================>

- Uses Rojo
- Fully and strictly typed + method documentation
- Lots of settings and customizability per Zone 100+ combinations

- External: 
  - Uses GoodSignal

- **[!]**: Has script injection for a CollisionGroup and a RemoteEvent used only upon a Zones creation to update tags on the Server *(There was nothing else I could do to keep it fully client sided AND have it operate and react to Streaming Enabled)*
  
--=====================================================================>

**[NOTICE]:**

*There are much simplier (less bloated) ways to query parts in Zones. This is mainly trying to implement all the features of ZonePlus and more for those who have used ZonePlus and are comfortable with its API. A "drag and drop" replacement with some API name changes.*
